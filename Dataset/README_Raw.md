The human annotated files have information in the image file name that relates to their ID and their location in the flat fielded images.

The first part is the identification. Codes are as follows (for the 10 file test – other categories exist but this includes most of them).

Chaeto = chaetognath or arrow worm

Copepod = copepod

Fish = fish larva

Hydro = hydromedusa or jellyfish

Cteno = ctenophore or comb jelly

LC = lobate ctenophore (a ctenophore with 2 lobes that is uses for feeding)

Pleuro = Pleurobrachia = a type of ctenophore with 2 long and thin tentacle

Siphon = siphonophore (a type of gelatinous animal)

Unk = unknown = a living animal that was hard to identify or just odd and worth saving but not abundant enough for a new category

Shrimp = shrimp = probably a decapod or mysid shrimp

Cumacean = cumacean (another type of shrimp with a tail that curls upward and a small head)

Zooea = crab zooea or crab larva

Stomato = stomatopod larva

Ptero = pteropod (also known as a “sea butterfly”)

Poly = polychaete worm

Here is an example of the file name broken down:

fish_Dataset3_20110724081513125.tif_122_462_1036_175_169.tiff

fish = ID

Dataset3_20110724081513125.tif = name of the tiff stack where it was found

122 = the frame number within the stack (out of 300 or the total number in the stack)

462 = the x location in the image of the top left corner of the box used to crop the animal

1036 = the y location in the image of the top left corner of the box used to crop the animal

175 = width of the box surrounding the animal

169 = Height of the box surrounding the animal
