The human annotated files have information in the image file name that relates to their ID and their location in the flat fielded images.
The first part is the identification. Codes are as follows (for the 10 file test – other categories exist but this includes most of them).
Chaeto = chaetognath (also known as a “arrow worm”)
Fish = larval fish
Hydro = Hydromedusa (small jellyfish)
LC = lobate ctenophore (comb jelly)
Pleuro = Pleurobrachia (another type of comb jelly that has long tentacles)
Shrimp = shrimp (crustacean, usually black)
Siphon = Siphonophore (another type of gelatinous animal)
Stomato = stomatopod larva (also known as a mantis shrimp)
Unk = Unknown (other living things that were large but did not belong to a major category)

Here is an example of the file name broken down:
fish_Dataset3_20110724081513125.tif_122_462_1036_175_169.tiff
fish = ID
Dataset3_20110724081513125.tif = name of the tiff stack where it was found
122 = the frame number within the stack (out of 300 or the total number in the stack)
462 = the x location in the image of the top left corner of the box used to crop the animal
1036 = the y location in the image of the top left corner of the box used to crop the animal
175 = width of the box surrounding the animal
169 = Height of the box surrounding the animal
