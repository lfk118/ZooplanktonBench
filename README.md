# ZooplanktonCV: A Benchmark Dataset for Zooplankton Recognition in Images and Videos
This is the PyTorch implementation of our paper. It proposes a benchmark for Zooplankton recognition in images and videos. For more visualization results, you can check on our [website](https://lfk118.github.io/ZooplanktonCV_Webpage).

## Installation
If you want to run all our tests, please install the library in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/lfk118/ZooplanktonCV/blob/main/requirements.txt). 

For installing GroundingDINO, please refer to their [official GitHub](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO). Once you finish installing it, you can just read the [README.md](https://github.com/lfk118/ZooplanktonCV/blob/main/GroundingDINO/README.md) in the GroundingDINO folder for next step.

## Dataset Preparation
We provided all the datasets we used with [this link](https://outlookuga-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/fl79416_uga_edu/EhtmuP6IOTpErtRhcVR3s-oBegeA4cOb46Bkpel6eyMDFg?e=C1dewu)  
For the usage of these datasets please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/lfk118/ZooplanktonCV/blob/main/Dataset/README.md) in the dataset folder.
