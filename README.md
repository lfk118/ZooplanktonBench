# ZooplanktonCV: A Benchmark Dataset for Zooplankton Detection, Classification, and Tracking
This is the PyTorch implementation of our paper. It proposes a benchmark for Zooplankton detection, classification, and tracking.

## Installation
If you want to run all our tests, please install the library in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/lfk118/ZooplanktonCV/blob/main/requirements.txt). 
## Dataset Preparation
We provided all the datasets we used with [This is a link]()
If you only want to run GPT-4V, the dataset is [This is a link]()
If you only want to run the GroundingDINO / YOLOv8, the dataset is[This is a link]()
For the usage of these datasets please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/lfk118/ZooplanktonCV/blob/main/Dataset/README.md) in the dataset folder.
